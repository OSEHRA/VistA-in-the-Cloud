# Introduction

The VistA in the Cloud (VitC) environment is a sandbox where third parties - external to VA and OSEHRA - can test their software against a VistA instance operating in a production-like environment with synthetic patients.
Each  VitC sandbox environment will contain:
   * A copy of the VistA Windows clients
   * A copy of VistA on a virtual Linux box
   * Links on the Windows VM desktop for visualizing VistA and a dashboard for dox/tests

Presented here is an outline for establishing a VitC sandbox. There are many areas that need further polishing.

# Azure Account Access Needed

The consumer services requires access to the Azure Commercial Cloud (https://portal.azure.us).

Once an account is established, logging in is included as a part of each of the scripts described below.

# Azure Portal

## Sandbox Creation

</a>

### Sandbox Configuration

Required Fields:
  * `vnetName` Default: `VITC-Sandbox`
# Note that the value of vnetName needs to be unique across Azure namespaces.  Please use a unique name for the vnetName; else, the system will not allow the deployment of the VMs.
  * `vnetCIDR` Default: `10.7.0.0/24`
    * If you are running more than 1 sandbox, or have a Virtual Network that includes 10.7.0.0/24, you will need to find a new CIDR to deploy the sandbox into.  If you only have additional sandboxes you can increment the third octet by 1, i.e. 10.7.1.0/24.
  * `adminUsername` Default: `VITCAdmin`
  * `adminPassword` Default: `NULL`

You must either create a new resource group, or add the sandbox to an existing one, then choose an admin password that you can access the Windows VM with.

Once the Sandbox is created you can access it via RDP using the `adminUsername` and `adminPassword`.  You will have to get the Windows VM public IP address from your resource group.

## Sandbox Deletion

* Remove resource group, Default: `VITC-Sandbox`, and all resources will be deleted.

# Azure CLI

## Create Consumer Virtual Machines

The script is fully automated.  The only required flag is `-g`, if you are building an enterprise setup you will also need: `-c, -e, and -r`.

  * Run `. ./main_create_script.sh -g <ORG-NAME>` which has the following flags:
  * `-h | --help` Print help text
  * `-a | --ad-name` Name of the Domain Controller 1 VM
  * `-c | --common-vent <COMMON VNET NAME>` Name of the Common VNET where the Domain Controllers are located
  * `-d | --dc-servers <IP,ADDRESSES>` Comma seperated list of the domain controller IP's
  * `-e | --enterprise` Flag to add a sandbox to an Enterprise setup
  * `-g | --group <GROUP NAME>` Name of organization to generate the Resource Group (No Spaces, replace with a dash `-`)
  * `-p | --password` Option to enter a password for Active Directory User
  * `-r | --common-rg <COMMON RG NAME>` Name of the Common Resource group where the Domain Controllers are located
  * `-o | --octet <SECOND CIDR OCTET>` Octet number under 10.

Once the script is complete, you can access the Windows VM's using the following credentials:
  * `username` osehra
  * `password` The generated password or self supplied password if `-p` was used.

Logging into the Linux machine can be done via PuTTY links on the Windows VM desktop.  It will give you an opportunity to interact with the Docker container. Port 9430 is the XWB Broker port; 8001 is VistALink; 2222 is an ssh into the Docker container; and 57772 is the Cach√© Portal.

Logging into the Windows machine (the admin username and IP is displayed during provisioning) will give you a desktop with all the VistA clients. You will be able to log-in into VistA using CPRS.

### Enterprise Notes

  * You will be asked to supply the Active Directory password, the Organization AD (Active Directory) Username (Default: <group>.admin), First name (Default: Org), and Last name (Default: Admin).
  * Once the script is complete you can login with the AD Username and AD User Password

## Destroy Consumer Virtual Machines

This script will destroy all resources related to a specific organization

* Run `. ./main_destroy_script.sh -g <ORG-NAME>`. which has the following flags:
  * `-h | --help` Print help text
  * `-a | --ad-name` Name of the Domain Controller 1 VM
  * `-c | --common-vent <COMMON VNET NAME>` Name of the Common VNET where the Domain Controllers are located
  * `-e | --enterprise` Flag to add a sandbox to an Enterprise setup
  * `-g | --group <GROUP NAME>` Name of organization resource group
  * `-r | --common-rg <COMMON RG NAME>` Name of the Common Resource group where the Domain Controllers are located

# Software Needed

## Azure Scripts
In order to deploy this sandbox, first install the Azure Command-line Interface (CLI) (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest). These scripts have been validated for Linux, Windows and MacOS. This step can be done on any laptop from which you can access Azure, if you have local Admin rights.

## Azure Templates
None

# Enterprise Setup

## Create Infrastructure Services

Depending on your setup, this is either fully automated, or broken up into automated scripts and a manual configuration step.

The required scripts are housed in the [templates](./templates).

### New VNET Setup:

<a href="https://transmogrify.azurewebsites.net/templates/enterprise/initial/azuredeploy.json" target="_blank">
    <img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/>
</a>

* Navigate to [core-network](./core-network)
* Click on the Deploy Azure button that matches your setup
* Fill in the required fields:
  * `adminUsername` Default: "EnterpriseAdmin"
    * Domain Controller Server/Active Directory Admin username
  * `adminPassword` Default: **NULL**
    * Domain Controller Server/Active Directory Admin password
  * `domainName` Default: "devnet.contoso.us"
    * Active Directory domain name
  * `jumpBoxVmSize` Default: "Standard_D2_v2"
    * Server size for the Windows Jumpbox
  * `DCVmSize` Default: "Standard_D1_v2"
    * Server size for the Domain Controllers
* This will create a new Virtual Network (VNET) with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16 with two subnets 10.0.0.0/24 & 10.0.1.0/24.  The Domain Controller 1 & 2 will be in the first subnet and the Active Directory Forest setup. The Jumpbox will be in the second subnet.  It will also set the VNET DNS servers to 10.0.0.4 and 10.0.0.5.

### Existing VNET Setup:

* Navigate to [existing-network](./existing-network)
* Click on the Deploy Azure button that matches your setup
* Fill in the required fields:
  * `vnetName` Default: "Common"
    * Name of the VNET you want to deploy the stack into
  * `vnetPrimarySubnetPrefix` Default: "10.0.0.0/24"
    * The CIDR block for the first subnet to create within the existing VNET
  * `vnetSecondarySubnetPrefix` Default: "10.0.1.0/24"
    * The CIDR block for the second subnet to create within the existing VNET
  * `adminUsername` Default: "EnterpriseAdmin"
    * Domain Controller Server/Active Directory Admin username
  * `adminPassword` Default: **NULL**
    * Domain Controller Server/Active Directory Admin password
  * `domainName` Default: "devnet.contoso.us"
    * Active Directory domain name
  * `DCVmSize` Default: "Standard_D1_v2"
    * Server size for the Domain Controllers
* This will add two subnets 10.0.0.0/24 & 10.0.1.0/24 to your existing VNET.  The Domain Controller 1 will be launched in the first subnet, and the Active Directory Forest setup.
* In the Azure panel, you have to manually go to Virtual networks -> <vnetName> -> DNS Servers and change it from `Default (Azure-provided)` to `Custom` and add in the Domain Controller IP's.  If you are using the defaults it will be 10.0.0.4 & 10.0.0.5, otherwise it will use the first three octets of your first subnet you created in the existing VNET and the fourth octet will be 4 & 5.  Ex: VNET CIDR: 10.1.0.0/16, first subnet 10.1.5.0/24, second subnet 10.1.5.1/24.  The Domain Controllers will be 10.1.5.4 and 10.1.5.5.
* Once the DNS Servers are updated, you will need to reboot all Virtual Machines in the VNET.  It's required to reboot the Domain Controller 1 server first since it's the main DNS server.
* Navigate to [add-dc-existing](./add-dc-existing)
* Click on the Deploy Azure button that matches your setup
* Fill in the required fields:
  * `vnetName` Default: "Common"
    * Name of the VNET you want to deploy the stack into
  * `vnetPrimarySubnetPrefix` Default: "10.0.0.0/24"
    * The CIDR block for the first subnet to create within the existing VNET
  * `adminUsername` Default: "EnterpriseAdmin"
    * Domain Controller Server/Active Directory Admin username
  * `adminPassword` Default: **NULL**
    * Domain Controller Server/Active Directory Admin password
  * `domainName` Default: "devnet.contoso.us"
    * Active Directory domain name
  * `jumpBoxVmSize` Default: "Standard_D2_v2"
    * Server size for the Windows Jumpbox
  * `DCVmSize` Default: "Standard_D1_v2"
    * Server size for the Domain Controllers
* The fields should use the same information that you supplied in `existing-network` so that the second Domain Controller and the Jumpbox can join the domain and complete the network setup (Since these servers are being joined to the domain they will pick up the VNET DNS settings without needing to reboot).

### Manaul Configuration Requirements

@TODO create PowerShell script to automate this step.

Once you have the Infrastructure setup, you will need do the following manual steps:
* Remote Desktop to the Jumpbox
* From the Jumpbox, Remote Desktop to Domain Controller 1
* From the `Server Manager` dashboard:
  * In the upper right hand coner click `Tools`
  * Select `Active Directory Users and Computers`
* From `Active Directory Users and Computers`:
  * Right click on the domain
  * Choose `New` -> `Organizational Unit`
  * Name: `VITC-Machines`
  * Click `Ok`
